This is a homebrew game for the Atari 2600 inspired by the classic Chrome Dinosaur Game, with some added gameplay tweaks. It's written in Batari Basic, a dialect of BASIC designed for programming the Atari 2600.

The core structure of this game is based on the ["Tinkernut World Deluxe"](https://www.randomterrain.com/atari-2600-memories-batari-basic-commands.html#ex_tinkernut_world_deluxe) example program. The game itself might not be very polished as it was made for fun as a learning exercise.

Requirements:

  - Atari 2600 console or an emulator.
  - Batari Basic compiler (https://github.com/batari-Basic/batari-Basic), the instructions for compiling the .bas file can be found on the repo. Some emulators (e.g. Stella) also support running .bas files directly.
